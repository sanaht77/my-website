        <p>Hi! I'm Sanah Tatla, a second year computer science student at Simon Fraser University.
        My love for programming began in highschool, when I joined my highschool Vex Robotics team. 
        As a programmer, I worked on position tracking algorihms, driver control, autonomous programming, and 
        documentation. I quickly fell in love with the tedious, yet rewarding, cycle of problem solving. 
        Apart from programming, I have many other hobbies. Gaming is one of them, and I even built my own PC and keyboard.
        I love hiking and reading books as well.
        </p>
